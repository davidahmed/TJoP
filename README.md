## The Joy of Python
A collection of IPython Notebooks.

>  “A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.” 
> ***― Alan Perlis***

All programming languages are equal but some are more equal. You could solve the same problem in C or Lisp or Fortran, but some would be more productive across most of the common avenues that programmers have to deal with. Programming languages are not mere descriptions, they are a means that dictate how one may think and hopefully approach and solve a given problem. 

This repository is an invitation to the newcomers to the language to witness how the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language could especially be a good choice for **solving** various kind of problems. Often, as it should be obvious from the notebooks, it's easier and sometimes even faster to program the solutions than to explain them in a natural language!

**Considerations for the Notebooks**
* Simple is better than complex.
* There is a deliberate attempt to stick (as much as possible) to stay within the Python Standard library (Py 3.7.x).
* Wherever appropriate, I have used a functional programming approach, and wherever using higher abstractions were apt, I preferred them. Often, they end up being common Python idioms.
* Each Notebook (and if possible, sections therein) should be independent and separabale units of code. Files, if present, sit at the folder root of the notebook.

## Notebooks:
1. Vocabulary Analysis of the German Language.  *#NLP*
2. Project Euler with Python. *#Competitive Programming, #Mathematical Methods*
